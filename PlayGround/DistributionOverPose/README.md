This sub-directory explores the problem of: 
How to we go from a set of pixelwise distributions over 3D coordintes to a dsitribution over poses.

Primarly, we explore some theoretical solutions on toy datasets to identify whether the logic behind those methods is sound. Once this is confirmed we implment those methods to a global pipelien for solving the original task.
